### Source Code

```
Hey.
This is my program i made in about 2 days.
Its a http webserver that supports PHP, PERL and my own simply language (still under heavy development) called PSI.
It also has alot of extra neat features you can use.
This 2 day project has gotten bigger, and now im on version 1.3, and its still being made better.
I Released this program under the GNU Public Licence, so it has the source code included.
My Website hosts all the vb made server apps, all free including source.
Http://enw.uni.cc
If you wish to see updateds made by me , go there , or to downloaded the latest version go there. Ill let you go there to download it instead of downloading off psc.
this applys to version 1.3.
Current Package size = 200 - 300 kb. including source code, htdocs, docs, and binaries.
Please read the txt files in the docs folder.They have alot of info about how to use my server.
other info:
This was NOt made by the same makers as Titan FTP Server.
If you think you may get a virus from the binaries, just run the source :P
alright, PLEASE vote. vote however, i just want any votes that are your true oppinion on my program. also please leave comments. id love to se what you think!
